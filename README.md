# clj-jri

A simple wrapper library for JRI, Java/R interface, mostly to draw charts on R.


## Preparation

You may need to install R library "JGR/rJava" (https://rforge.net/JGR/linux.html) on R by "install.packages('rJava')" and have to set the following environment variables.

(example)
export R_HOME=/usr/lib/R/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib

You also need to place REngine.jar, JRI.jar and libjri.so from the original project site onto LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

To install the library locally, the following process is recommended.

lein clean
lein deps
lein compile
lein jar
lein uberjar
lein localrepo install ./target/clj-jri-0.0.1-standalone.jar clj-jri 0.0.1-standalone


## Examples and notes
